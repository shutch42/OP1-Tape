Problem:

The number of audio chunks per second is not sync-ed with the number of frames per second. Attempting to play audio at a different rate sounds bad.

Some ideas:
- Calculate chunk size to reasonably match frame rate
- Make a parallel solution, so audio plays on a separate core at a constant rate
- Idk, maybe a data structure to better track frame/audio position
